      <h1>Professional Experience</h1>
          <p><h3>Prior to my enrollment at Virginia Tech, I gained invaluable experience at TTM Technologies, a circuit board manufacturing firm. This early venture into the professional world left a lasting impact on me. It underlined the importance of meeting deadlines, encouraged a creative approach to problem-solving, and, most significantly, provided me with a genuine taste of the working world at a young age.</h3></p>
      
     <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p><h3>I have completed several CS-related projects, including "MazeRunner," a two-player video game similar to Pac-Man, developed using Java. I've also created a Python-based Discord bot, "Upliftify," integrated with the Tenor GIF API. Additionally, I developed a mod for the popular video game "Valheim" using C++ and Unity. Furthermore, I've collaborated on various school projects with my peers.</h3></p>
    
    <h2>Aspirations</h2>
       <p><h3>I aspire to make a significant global impact through Computer Science. By educating myself about concurrent technology, I aim to solve real-world challenges, innovate, and create solutions that improve lives. I'm driven to contribute to the ever-evolving field, using it as a force for positive change on a broader scale.</h3></p>
<h2>Competence</h2>
       <p><h3>My personal and professional values play a crucial role in shaping my competence in this field. A creative mindset and a strong work ethic drive me to deliver high-quality results and continuously strive for improvement. My effective communication skills enable me to work efficiently in team-based scenarios.   </h3></p>

 <h2>Non CS related Projects</h2>

<p><h3>Beyond Computer Science, I have also participated in hands-on projects through collaborations. One of the projects I have worked on in the past is a cost-effective, marketable, and functional mockup of a remote-control submarine. Additionally, I have been involved in another project, a small-scale hydraulic drawbridge, which operates based on fluid physics and is fully functional, capable of supporting up to 20 lbs of force.  </h3></p>
